<H1 align="center"> ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PGeorge2004 </H1>
        I don't yet have the skills to work as a programmer but thank you for acknowledging my existence in this sea of programmers.
 However I am an undergraduate at the Department of Informatics and Telecommunications at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens.
         I hope you revisit me in the future (approximately 2 to 3 years) when I will have the skills and the experience be useful.
                                          Bye, for now, and thanks for the visit!ðŸ‘‹
